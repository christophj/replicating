title : About me and this blog
description: Short bio
---

I'm a PhD student in finance from the Technical University of Munich. I do quite a bit of empirical work, almost exclusively in [R](http://www.r-project.org/). Because I think that you learn best by actually doing it, not by just reading about it, I replicated a few finance papers and learned some tricks about R. On this blog, I want to share my work and hope that there are some of you who find it useful.

When I don't replicate finance papers or ponder about my own research, I love watching movies. Also, I get excited about tech stuff: Android, Linux, R packages, you name it. I love to play around with it, but sadly, I'm not really an expert in any of those...

**Disclaimer**: I do not guarantee that any of the replications are absolutely correct. So please, if you have to replicate some paper for one of your studies, feel free to take my code as a starting point, but make sure to check the correctness yourself. Also, this is a blog and I write here about papers I found interesting, but that I am not necessarily an expert in (to be fair, I wouldn't consider myself an expert in any field of finance). So while I try to get the arguments of the authors correctly, I might be sloppy from time to time. So don't take anything here for the final truth, read and understand the papers yourself! And don't hesitate to let me know when you find an error in my code or a wrong argument.
